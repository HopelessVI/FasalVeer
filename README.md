## üí° The Problems We're Solving

- **Soil Degradation & Pollution:**  
  Overuse of fertilizers depletes nutrients and contaminates water bodies, contributing to eutrophication and greenhouse gas emissions.
  
- **Inefficient Fertilizer Application:**  
  Farmers lack access to precise, data-driven fertilizer recommendations, resulting in wasteful usage and lower yields.
  
- **Economic Strain & Resource Management Issues:**  
  Poor management of fertilizers, water, and equipment increases operational costs, reduces productivity, and strains farmer profitability.
